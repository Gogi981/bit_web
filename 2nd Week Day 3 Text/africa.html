    <p id="a1">Africa is the world's second largest and second most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7
        million
        square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land
        area.[3]
        With 1.2 billion people[1] as of 2016, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. The continent
        is
        surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the
        Indian
        Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various
        archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto
        independent states with limited or no recognition.[4] The majority of the continent and its countries are in the
        Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

    <p id="a2">Africa's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[5][6] the median age in 2012 was
        19.7,
        when
        the worldwide median age was 30.4.[7] Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by
        population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and
        the
        Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors as well
        as
        later ones that have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis,
        Australopithecus
        africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergasterâ€”the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human),
        found in
        Ethiopia, date to circa 200,000 years ago.[8] Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate
        areas;
        it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.</p>
    <p id="a3"> Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century,
        European
        countries
        colonised almost all of Africa; most present states in Africa emerged from a process of decolonisation in the
        20th
        century. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in
        Addis
        Ababa.</p>
