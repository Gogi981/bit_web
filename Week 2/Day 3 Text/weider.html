    <h2>Life and career</h2>
    <p id="para1">Weider was born in <q>Montréal, Québec, Canada,</q> to Louis and Anna Weider, Polish Jewish emigrants
        from the
        town of
        Kurów, Poland. He published the first issue of Your Physique magazine in 1940,[1] and built a set of barbells
        out of car wheels and axles the same year out of the family garage on Coloniale Street in Montréal. He designed
        numerous training courses beginning in the 1950s, including the Weider System of Bodybuilding.</p>
    <p id="para2">He married Hedwiges "Vicky" Uzar; together they had one child, Lydia Ross (mother to Weider's three
        grandchildren), and subsequently divorced in 1960.[2] During his marriage to Vicky Uzar he had met Betty
        Brosmer, who was then the highest paid pin-up girl in the U.S.[3] In 1961 Joe and Betty married, and she began
        working alongside him as Betty Weider. Betty and Joe together authored books on bodybuilding.[4] Joe and Ben
        together were the co-founders of the International Federation of BodyBuilders.[5]</p>

        called
        Schiff
        Nutrition International, they were the creators of Tiger's Milk nutrition bars and related products, one of the
